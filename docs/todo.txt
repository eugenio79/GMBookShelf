todo:

- put the repo on github
- create the "detail" view controller
- put an activity indicator on the footer when the app is fetching new items
- rename the app, create an app icon and a launch screen
- use a UICollectionView instead of a UITableView in order to have different views for different devices, e.g. multiple columns on bigger screen
- split items in sections, each section is a "page"
- let the user choose number of items per page (and reload the items on change)
- put the downloaded images on cache and create a plist to retrieve them
- put an activity indicator in the center of the page for the first load
- put an activity indicator on the status bar when there's networking activity
