- What if I start the app without connectivity?
- item details and image download should be implemented with an observer pattern, in order to be listened by detail too
- iPad: improve the layout of the "detail" view controller (e.g. increase font size of author and price)
- enhance collectionView header and footer layout
- rename the app, create an app icon and a launch screen
- let the user choose number of items per page (and reload the items on change)
- put the downloaded images on cache and create a plist to retrieve them
- put an activity indicator on the status bar when there's networking activity
